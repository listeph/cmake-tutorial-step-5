# CMake Tutorial Step 5

Used for [OSS Lab 8 Checkpoint 4](https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-4470-OpenSource/blob/master/Modules/08.TestingAndCI/Lab-TestingAndCI.md) using the source code from [cmake.org's CMake tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html). This is from step 5 of the tutorial which includes tests on the application in `CMakeLists.txt` which can be run using `ctest -N` and `ctest -VV` from the binary directory.
